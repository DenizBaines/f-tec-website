      description: "In the year 2000, F-TEC for the first time brought forward a social franchising concept which evolved as a sustainable model. The idea was to engage First Generation Entrepreneurs with complete support & know-how from F-TEC with a moderate franchisee fee, without bringing any other cost head for research & development, content development & centralised advertisement. It came out as a sustainable model, wherein, even after students pay a moderate fee, the franchises are able to generate a fair profit and good return on their investments.",
